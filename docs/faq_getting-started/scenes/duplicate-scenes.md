# Duplicate Scenes

{: .important }
**Search using keywords, filters, and PHashes.**

Before submitting a scene to StashDB, always check for duplicates first. Duplicates will [likely be rejected or removed]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/adding-scenes/#duplicate-scenes). If you couldn't find a match through Stash's [Scene Tagger]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#using-stashdb), the easiest way to check is to rely on [PHash]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#whats-a-phash) detection when [submitting a draft]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#using-stashdb) to StashDB. Your draft edit will have a warning sign (⚠) at the top if your PHash matches existing scenes in the database. These are not always duplicate scenes and may be due to someone [submitting incorrect fingerprints]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started-stashdb/#backlog-spreadsheet). Duplicates may also be found by searching for the title on StashDB or by filtering by studio on a performer's page. Also be aware that even if your scene isn't on StashDB yet, someone could have a pending edit to create the same scene. Best way to check for this is to click the favorite star (⭐) on the relevant studio or performer in your submission and [filter for favorites in pending scene creations](https://stashdb.org/edits?favorite=true&operation=create&status=pending&type=scene){:target="_blank"} on the Edits page.
