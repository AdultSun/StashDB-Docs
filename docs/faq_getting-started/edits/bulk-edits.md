# Bulk Edits

{: .important }
**Big projects that require a large number of edits should be pitched on Discord first for approval.**

---

Any projects that would affect a large amount of data on StashDB and/or require a high volume of individual edits will need to be approved on Discord first by dropping a question in the **#stashdb-general** channel. If it's in line with the guidelines already established on this website, than a simple "heads up" before starting may be all that is needed from you. More drastic changes may require formal approval as a [guideline proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/guideline-proposals/) in the **#stashdb-guidelines** channel on Discord. Projects that would add more than a few dozen edits into the queue at a time may need to be broken up into smaller chunks. All of these points apply to both manual submissions and automated submissions.
