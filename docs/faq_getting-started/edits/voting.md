# Voting on StashDB

{: .important }
**Different voting thresholds apply to destructive vs. non-destructive edits. Voting rights granted automatically after 10 approved submissions.**

---

All edit submissions to StashDB will be subject to approval by the votes of other contributors. Voting rights will be granted automatically once you have 10 submissions approved.

Edits considered non-destructive may be approved immediately if they receive three unanimous YES votes. They may also be rejected immediately with three unanimous NO votes. Destructive edits (Merge and Destroy requests, mostly) and non-unanimous vote totals will require a waiting period to pass before it is rejected or approved. This may be 3 days or 7 days, depending on the current vote total. Net totals of 0 votes will still be approved at the end of the waiting period for non-destructive edits but will be rejected for destructive edits. For more details on a particular edit, hovering your cursor over "Voting closes in X days" in the top right corner will show you if it will be rejected or approved with the current vote total as well as the exact day and time the voting period will end.

The ABSTAIN option is only used if you would like to remove your YES or NO vote rather than changing it. The "Save" button will not appear when ABSTAIN is selected unless you have previously saved a YES or NO vote on that edit.
