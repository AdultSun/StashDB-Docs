# Tag Edit Comments

{: .important }
**Say what you're doing, why you're doing it, and what your sources are.**

---

Regardless of what kind of edit you're submitting, always include in the comment field what you are doing and why. Bigger or more drastic changes will likely require longer comments, but simple changes likely won't need much. Also please remember to note what you are using as the [source of your edit]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/assigning-tags/#priority-sources-for-tags) when appropriate. These notes will be helpful when considering further edits on the tag later in addition to justifying your actions now to those who will be voting on it.
