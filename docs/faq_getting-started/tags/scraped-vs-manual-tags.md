# Scraped vs. Manual Tags

{: .important }
**Most tags attached to scenes were scraped from studio sources, not manually added by editors.**

---

Currently, most tags attached to scenes are scraped from the original studio or some other official source, not manually added from the editors of StashDB. Our current methods of manually adding/removing a scene's tags individually isn't too bad on a small scale, but they are far too tedious and time-consuming to be worth using for large shifts in our tag organization in most cases. This means that most of StashDB's tag list leans on scraped tags in their organization and usage, rather than attempting to enforce major deviations from those sources. This may explain inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or other peculiarities of a particular tag. [Reading through the edit comments](#read-tag-edit-histories) may explain in further detail.
