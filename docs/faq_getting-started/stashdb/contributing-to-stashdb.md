# Contributing to StashDB

{: .important }
**Submitting fingerprints is possible with every account but adding/editing anything else requires new permissions, read below for details.**

---

Every StashDB account is able to [submit fingerprints/hashes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/whats-a-phash/) from within the [Scene Tagger](https://docs.stashapp.cc/beginner-guides/guide-to-scraping/#use-the-scene-tagger){:target="_blank"} view of Stash. This does not require any additional permissions. However, if you would like to add or edit any scenes/performers/studios/tags, you will need to be granted additional privileges.

The process for gaining edit access is simple. First, you must read this **entire** article carefully and closely, following **all** of its instructions. After you finish reading, you must fill out a short application form. Every request will be reviewed individually by one of the admins. There will be an opportunity to reapply if your first request is rejected. The application process is described in more detail within this article and should take about 15-20 minutes, mostly depending on how fast you can read.

{: .warning }
**Please read the following sections carefully. Failing to follow these instructions may result in delays, rejections, or the loss of future editing privileges.**

## Make a StashDB Account

First, make sure you have an account on **StashDB.org**. There are other public stash-boxes that look very similar, but those are all hosted separately and require different accounts. We can't apply the EDIT role to an account that doesn't exist yet. Please see our guide to [Accessing StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/accessing-stashdb/) if you need any help finding an invite code, registering an account, or connecting it to Stash.

---

## Make a Discourse Account

You will also be **required to join our Discourse server**. This is the home to Stash's forums and will be the primary method for editors, mods, and admins to communicate with each other. You will also use Discourse to submit your request for edit access.

You may also [join our Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) if you'd like, but this is **not required** for StashDB editors. As a result, not all mods, admins, and devs will be available there.

**For Discord users**, we require your nickname (also called "display name") in our server to match your StashDB username. You can either [go to your user settings](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames){:target="_blank"} or type the shortcut `/nick <your-new-username>` into any channel of Stash's Discord server. This will only change the name displayed inside of Stash's Discord and not anywhere else. You may also request an admin to change your StashDB username instead (see below).

If you would like to **change your StashDB username**, please contact a StashDB admin on Discourse/Discord (preferably **@AdultSun**) and ask them politely to change it for you. You may be asked to DM the email address you used to join StashDB in order for the admin to verify your account. If there is any concern about your username, an admin may ask you to pick a different one before granting edit access.

## Guidelines Summary

All editors of StashDB are expected to follow our guidelines to ensure a high level of quality in their submissions. This website is home to an extensive number of requirements, recommendations, tips, and guides. You are **not** expected to memorize all of them right away. However, you **must** be familiar with the following list of guidelines **before submitting your request for edit access**. Read each section closely -- even if you think the topic is irrelevant to you -- before moving on to the next part of this article. If you'd like to learn more, further information can be found by clicking the hyperlinks to other articles.

### **Start slowly.**

Do not attempt to submit a large batch of edits immediately after gaining edit access. Take your time, try to keep your first submissions simple and small, and leave only a few edits pending at a time. Double-check the guidelines or ask on Discourse/Discord if you have any questions. And *always* keep an eye on the notifications bell for any comments or downvotes.

Everything you submit will sit in the edit queue where other editors can review them, voting for either approval or rejection. Everything goes much quicker and smoother when pending edits don't need any corrections. So, be patient and give yourself time to learn the ropes. Read more about the process in [Voting on StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/voting/) before voting on anything yourself.

### **Use helpful edit comments.**

You will not be able to submit your edit without including a comment first, so make it count. You will be expected to describe where you've sourced your data and explain why your data may be different compared to those sources. Fortunately, most edits are relatively straightforward and only use a single source, so there won't be much to explain. Typical comments for these kinds of edits include "scraped from studio" or "male performer from visual ID". For anything more complex, try to be as direct in your explanations as possible to make it easier for voters to parse. You can also use Markdown syntax to better format your comment.

### **Update pending edits.**

If you made a mistake or missed an important piece of information, another editor may downvote your edit and explain why in a comment. These will appear as notifications in the navigation bar across the top of StashDB. When this happens, you are expected to update your edit with the required changes. This will reset the current vote total and notify all commenters and voters of the update.

### **No underage performers.**

Any content including underage performers will never be allowed on StashDB. We ensure this by only allowing scenes from performers, studios, and platforms that follow age verification laws. These requirements are detailed in [Performer Eligibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/create/performer-eligibility/). Please DM an admin immediately if you see any underage content on StashDB.

### **No banned studios.**

In rare circumstances, StashDB admins may ban specific studios based on legality and consent. Anything from a studio with a pattern of violating their performers' consent (i.e., Girls Do Porn) is not allowed. All specific bans will be listed under [Banned Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/banned-studios/). This list may expand over time. Please DM an admin immediately if you see any banned content on StashDB.

### **No ineligible performer aliases.**

All performer names and aliases must be used as an official adult credit in order to be eligible. This means that any legal names or given names cannot be included as an alias just because it is publically known, reported, or even revealed by performers themselves. These requirements are explained in more detail in [Eligible Aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-aliases/eligible-aliases/). To be safe, do not add any [Suspicious Aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-aliases/suspicious-aliases/) that cannot be verified as eligible. If you see a suspicious name on StashDB, please DM an admin immediately.

### **Review your drafts.**

When you create an edit by clicking the "Submit to Stash-Box" option within Stash, it is not immediately submitted for approval. It is temporarily saved as a "draft" on StashDB and will expire after 24 hours. Make sure everything in your draft is accurate and complete before submitting it to the edit queue. Some info saved in Stash might not be included when generating the draft, and other kinds of data may need to be manually added. Currently, drafts are the only way to add new scenes to StashDB. Further instructions can be found in [How to Submit Drafts from Stash]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/drafts/submit-from-stash/#how-to-submit-drafts-from-stash).

### **Generate pHashes.**

Perceptual hashes are the "secret sauce" behind Stash and StashDB. If you submit any scenes to the queue without generating a pHash first, you will need to either resubmit the edit or add your fingerprints after the scene is approved. More info on pHashes and how to generate them can be found in [What's a pHash?]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/whats-a-phash/). Speaking of secret sauces, do you have a favorite ice cream topping? Be sure to include your answer as an "additional comment" in your application, don't tell anyone else, and keep reading.

### **Ineligible movie scenes.**

All scenes must be sourced from a 1st party digital studio. This means any scenes or movies sourced exclusively from a 3rd party retailer for rent or sale (i.e., Adult DVD Empire, Hot Movies, etc.) are not eligible for inclusion on StashDB at this time. Requirements for eligibility are explained in more detail for both [Full Movie Entries]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/full-movie-entries/) and [Split Movie Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/split-movie-scenes/). Please note that some websites act as both 1st party producers and 3rd party retailers simultaneously. In situations where a website acts as both a 1st party producer and a 3rd party retailer, only original content produced by the studio itself is eligible. For example, the only eligible scenes from Bang.com come from the [sub-studios listed under "Bang! Originals"](https://stashdb.org/studios/e653a89f-6794-4243-a748-2d808647d2d3){:target="_blank"}.

### **Exceptions for amateur content.**

All amateur scenes must use the creator as its studio, not the platform. Also, only certain amateur platforms (ManyVids, Clips4Sale, PornHub, MFC Share, etc.) are allowed. Paywalled subscription services (OnlyFans, Just for Fans, Patreon, etc.) are not allowed. Eligibility for amateur content is explained further in [Amateur Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/amateur-studios/). Also note that a single scene entry on StashDB may be used to cover multiple platforms, as explained in [Remasters, Redistributions, and Re-Releases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/re-releases/).

### **Exceptions for JAV content.**

Since JAV is almost exclusively released as full movie downloads, it has been granted an exception under our [Full Movie Entries]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/full-movie-entries/) guideline. We also have specific requirements on the formatting of [JAV Names]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-name/jav-names/).

### **Add or create missing performers.**

All performers listed by the studio must be included in your scene submission. This includes male performers in straight scenes. If the performer does not exist in the database already, they will need to be created *before* submitting the scene. Identifying uncredited performers is not required but strongly recommended whenever possible.

### **Check for duplicates first.**

The underlying Stash-Box software will automatically warn you of any duplicates based on title/name and fingerprints, but this doesn't catch everything. A quick search with a few carefully chosen keywords only takes a few seconds and could save everyone a lot of wasted time and effort as a result.

### **Familiarize yourself with our disciplinary process.**

At the discretion of the admins, your edit access may be revoked at any time. However, this is rare and usually comes with an official warning first. Always act with the best interests of the community in mind. Make your best effort to follow the guidelines, correcting any mistakes when asked. Remain civil and constructive in all communications. If you can do that, you'll be fine. Our article explaining [StashDB Moderation Enforcement]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/) details what behaviors may result in disciplinary action. It also addresses how and when edit access may be restored.

## Submitting Your Request

Requesting edit access is not difficult. **After you've read and followed all of the instructions above**, politely ask for edit access in Discourse using the link below. Remember to answer every question in the request form and wait patiently. An admin will review your application shortly, usually within a day or two. You will see their response as a notification within Discourse. If you fail to follow **any part** of these instructions, your application may be rejected. The admin reviewing your request might not explain why. You must return here and carefully read the entire article to find what requirement you may have missed, however small it may seem. You may submit a new request no sooner than 24 hours after your previous one.
