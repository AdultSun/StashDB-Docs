# Contributing to StashDB

{: .important }
**Submitting fingerprints is possible with every account but any other edit/submission requires new permissions, details found on Discord pinned to #stashdb-invites.**

---

Every StashDB account is able to submit fingerprints/hashes from within the Scene Tagger view of Stash. This does not require any additional permissions. However, if you would like to add or edit performers, scenes, studios, or tags, you will need to be granted additional privileges. Requesting edit access is not difficult. Detailed instructions can be found pinned to the **#stashdb-invites** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-our-discord/). Please note that you will be expected to be reachable on Discord if you become an active contributor on StashDB. This is because there is no messaging or notification system from within StashDB at this time. If we cannot reach you over Discord, your edit rights may be revoked by an admin after repeated violations of our guidelines.
