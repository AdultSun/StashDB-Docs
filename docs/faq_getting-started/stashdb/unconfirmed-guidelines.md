# Unconfirmed Guidelines

{: .important }
**Still expected to be followed but subject to change pending formal approval.**

---

Early on, many of this website's sections will have this message at the bottom:

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.

All this means is that the language has not been formally approved by the community in our **#stashdb-guidelines** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-our-discord/) yet. Contributors are still expected to follow these unconfirmed guidelines, but should know that they are subject to change in the near future.
