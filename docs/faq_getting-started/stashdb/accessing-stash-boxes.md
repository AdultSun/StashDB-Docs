# Accessing Stash-Boxes
{: .no_toc }

{: .important }
**Details on connecting StashDB and others to Stash.**

---

Stash-Box is the name of the software developed alongside Stash that StashDB runs on. While StashDB's scope is somewhat limited out of necessity, there are a few other publicly availably Stash-Boxes run by others outside of the Stash team. These other Stash-Boxes are still compatible with Stash. Details for all known public Stash-Boxes (including StashDB) are listed here.

If you need a more detailed walkthrough on how to register an account with one of these Stash-Boxes or how to connect that new account to your local Stash, please read the guide on [Accessing StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/accessing-stashdb/). Many details are specific to StashDB.org, but the process will be very similar for every Stash-Box. You'll just need to check the relevant table below to find your specific Stash-Box's homepage, invite code, and endpoint.
