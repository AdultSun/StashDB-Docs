# Accessing Stash-Boxes
{: .no_toc }

{: .important }
**Details on connecting StashDB and others to Stash.**

---

Stash-Box is the name of the software developed alongside Stash that StashDB runs on. While StashDB's scope is somewhat limited out of necessity, there are a few other publicly availably Stash-Boxes run by others outside of the Stash team. These other Stash-Boxes are still compatible with Stash. Details for all known public Stash-Boxes (including StashDB) are listed here.
