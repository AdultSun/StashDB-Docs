# Accessing StashDB

{: .important }
**Must create an account, details found on Discord pinned to #stashdb-invites.**

You will need to create a StashDB account to access it from within Stash. Instructions for creating an account and connecting it to Stash can only be found in [our Discord server]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-our-discord/) at this time. Look for the pinned messages in the **#stashdb-invites** channel for detailed instructions.
