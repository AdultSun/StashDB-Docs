The Stash Discord server is your best bet for finding help and resources relating to Stash, Stash-Box, and StashDB. You will need to have a Discord account and join our server in order to [access StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/accessing-stashdb/). You could create a temporary throwaway account on Discord for this purpose if you'd like. However, if you would like to [contribute more than just hashes to StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/contributing-to-stashdb/), you will also be expected to be reachable on Discord. If you've already joined, the link is in the sidebar to the left.
