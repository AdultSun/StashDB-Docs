# Backlog Spreadsheet

{: .important }
**Anything that can't be fixed from within StashDB yet should be logged here, including incorrect fingerprints.**

---

Not everything can be fixed directly from StashDB's UI. For these exceptions, we have a spreadsheet hosted on Google Sheets to log corrections until they can be handled at a later date. There are several pages in the backlog, so make sure you find the correct one. Its most common use right now is to log incorrect fingerprints.
