# StashDB Contribution Guidelines
{: .no_toc }
**Welcome to the StashDB Guidelines!**

This will serve as a guide and reference document for all contributors to StashDB. It hosts both [tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/) for new contributors as well as the guidelines themselves. Being familiar with both will help in getting your edits approved. If something is missing or doesn't make sense, please ask in either **#stashdb-general** or the **#ministry-of-truth** on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-our-discord/).

This website is very much a work in progress at this time so watch for significant updates in the coming days. It is hosted with GitHub Pages, so please direct any suggestions for improving this website to the [StashDB-Docs repo](https://github.com/stashapp/StashDB-Docs){:target="_blank"} as a PR or Issue. Feel free to contact **@AdultSun** on Discord with any suggestions as well.

## **StashDB Overview**
StashDB is our shared public instance of the Stash-Box software. It hosts information about a wide variety of scenes, studios, and performers that can be easily pulled into your own installation of Stash. It does not host any video files or link to any unofficial downloads.

Primarily, StashDB hosts information about relatively professional digital content of all orientations. This means all of the major digital networks are well covered. [Amateur content]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/amateur-studios/) hosted on a handful of platforms is also eligible for StashDB, but services like OnlyFans and Patreon are not. JAV is also allowed but is often subject to different guidelines. Most examples of [animated content]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/create/animated-studios/) and [full movies]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/full-movie-entries/) are not allowed at this time, but there are a few exceptions.

Some of the content not currently allowed on StashDB can be found on other publicly available Stash-Boxes. Unlike StashDB, these Stash-Boxes are not run by the Stash team but are still directly compatible with the Stash software. [A full list of Stash-Boxes can be found here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/accessing-stash-boxes/).

## **Category Overviews**
Guideline sections are organized by each main object type: [Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/), [Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/), [Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/), and [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/). These parent pages are then split into the actions you can take with each object: **Create**, **Edit**, **Merge**, and **Delete**. These **Edit** pages are broken down further into each available field for that object, reflecting the order in which they appear on StashDB.

Parent pages serve as overviews of the entire category. Sometimes they will include one sentence summaries of each guideline section followed by links to more detailed explanations. All of these can also be found on the left side of this webpage.

- [Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/)
- [Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/)
- [Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/)
- [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/)

## **Getting Started Pages**
The following **Getting Started** sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require formal approval. The first topic named [StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/) covers broader topics that aren't exclusive to a single category. The rest are organized by each main heading across the top of StashDB. All of these can also be found on the left side of this webpage under [FAQ / Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/).
