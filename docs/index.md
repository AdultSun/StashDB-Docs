# StashDB Contribution Guidelines
{: .no_toc }
**Welcome to the StashDB Guidelines!**

This will serve as a guide and reference document for all contributors to StashDB. It hosts both [tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/) for new contributors as well as the guidelines themselves. Being familiar with both will help in getting your edits approved. If something is missing or doesn't make sense, please ask in either **#stashdb-general** or the **#ministry-of-truth** on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-our-discord/).

This website is very much a work in progress at this time so watch for significant updates in the coming days. It is hosted with GitHub Pages, so please direct any suggestions for improving this website to the [StashDB-Docs repo](https://github.com/stashapp/StashDB-Docs){:target="_blank"} as a PR or Issue. Feel free to contact **@AdultSun** on Discord with any suggestions as well.

## **Category Overviews**
Guideline sections are organized by each main object type: [Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/), [Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/), [Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/), and [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/). These parent pages are then split into the actions you can take with each object: Create, Edit, Merge, and Delete. "Edit" pages are broken down further into each available field for that object, reflecting the order in which they appear on StashDB.

Parent pages serve as overviews of the entire category. Sometimes they will include one sentence summaries of each guideline section followed by links to more detailed explanations. All of these can also be found on the left side of this webpage.

- [Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/)
- [Scenes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/)
- [Studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/)
- [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/)

## **Getting Started Pages**
The following **Getting Started** sections are general advice and explanations for potentially confusing aspects in our database. Because they don't represent explicit decisions concerning database management or curation, they do not require formal approval. The first topic named [StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/) covers broader topics that aren't exclusive to a single category. The rest are organized by each main heading across the top of StashDB. All of these can also be found on the left side of this webpage under [FAQ / Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/).
