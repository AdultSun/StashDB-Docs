# Performer Self-Identity

{: .important }
**In the case a performer's self-identity doesn't match how they present professionally, prefer their self-identity.**

---

When a performer identifies as a gender that doesn't align with how they present professionally, use their self-identity. An example of how this may arise is if a performer who professionally works as a female, identifies as non-binary personally.
