### Preferred Performer Names
- **Prefer unique names over commonly used aliases, but otherwise no hard rules only suggestions.**

There are no hard guidelines for choosing primary performer names at this time. However, more unique aliases are almost always preferred over common single word names like "Lola" or "Tony". The following should also be taken into consideration: most frequently used alias, most famous/popular alias, most commonly used name on other databases like IAFD, and alias currently/recently preferred by the performer (often determined by social media profiles).

Also be aware that names are only eligible to be primary names if they've been used as an official adult credit, following the same requirements as [eligible performer aliases](#eligible-performer-aliases).

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Eligible Performer Aliases
- **Must be an official adult credit, no legal names allowed except when a stage name is also their given name.**

Performer aliases must be names that have been used as official credits in an adult video performance. They do not have to be names used as performance aliases in a scene already listed on StashDB. This means that names that have been used professionally in non-adult mainstream performances, listed in credits or bylines as a writer or author, used on public social media accounts, or listed in news articles are not eligible to be listed on StashDB unless they've also been used as an official adult credit.

This also means that outside of the rare occasion of someone regularly using their given name instead of a stage name, **legal names are not allowed anywhere on StashDB**.

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Diacritics in Performer Names
- **Diacritics should be included in the primary name with the name without diacritics being added as an alias.**

Diacritics are the glyphs added on the letters. Most popular ones are acute ( ◌́ ) and grave ( ◌̀ ), but all diacritics should be use if it is part of the performer name. Example [Vitória Vonteese](https://stashdb.org/performers/fbd10ce7-3209-4788-b84f-3a2ec1b19326).

The only exception is [JAV Performer Names](#jav-performer-names). 

### JAV Performer Names
- **Western order with simplified Latin characters as default primary name, all other spellings as aliases.**

JAV performers often have their names ordered in three different ways: Western order (GivenName FamilyName) with Latin characters, Japanese order (FamilyName GivenName) with Latin characters, and Japanese order with Japanese characters. Different sources will prefer different spellings. For StashDB, we prefer the Western order with Latin characters for all JAV performers as the primary name, matching the formatting of our non-JAV performers. This also makes things simpler for crossover performers who have worked in both Western and JAV productions. Names in the reverse order should always be included as aliases.

To give an example, we use the name [Marica Hase](https://stashdb.org/performers/d4f1a54f-ddc7-4f50-a356-d417802cab1c){:target="_blank"} on StashDB. She has done many Western scenes after starting on the JAV side of things, but her primary name is the same regardless of whether she's considered a JAV performer or a Western performer: `Marica Hase`. Alternate spellings `Hase Marica` and `はせまりか` are included as aliases. All three are the same name, just spelled three different ways following three different formats.

The same [guidelines for picking a primary name](#preferred-performer-names) apply equally to JAV and Western performers. However, JAV performers may also have the same name spelled in various ways following various different conventions for using Latin characters. Typically, StashDB prefers the use of a simplified Hepburn romanization for primary names which avoids the use of double vowels like `oo` or `uu` as well as diacritic marks like `ō` or `ū`. This is also the same spelling preferred by [X/s List](https://xslist.org/en){:target="_blank"} which is one of the only remaining JAV databases in English. However, an exception may be allowed on a case-by-case basis if a particular romanization for their name that does not follow this convention is the most commonly used or is known to be the performer's preferred spelling. Again, these are the [same guidelines](#preferred-performer-names) for choosing alternate spellings of Western performer names and they still apply here as well. But due to the difficulty for non-Japanese speakers to determine this for all but the most popular Japanese performers, using the simplified Hepburn spelling as the default should cover most JAV performers without requiring additional research.

As another example, we prefer the spelling of [Yu Shinoda](https://stashdb.org/performers/8465400a-eb3c-4c3f-a78f-09d7541cf27d){:target="_blank"} as the primary name instead of `Yuu Shinoda` or `Yū Shinoda`. If we were creating this performer for the first time, this would be a safe first assumption because it avoids using double vowels or diacritic marks and matches the spelling used on [X\s List](https://xslist.org/en/model/13.html){:target="_blank"}. If we really wanted to dig deeper (which isn't required for an initial creation and is only possible because she's a popular performer), we'd find different romaji spellings used on [Minnano-AV](http://www.minnano-av.com/actress504478.html){:target="_blank"}, [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6193437/){:target="_blank"}, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11603788){:target="_blank"}, and even her own [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yuu_shinoda){:target="_blank"}. But since [her agency](http://www.t-powers.co.jp/official/talent/%e7%af%a0%e7%94%b0%e3%82%86%e3%81%86/){:target="_blank"}, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yu_shinoda){:target="_blank"}, [IAFD](https://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=yushinoda/gender=f/yu-shinoda.htm){:target="_blank"}, [FreeOnes](https://www.freeones.com/yu-shinoda){:target="_blank"}, and [Babepedia](https://www.babepedia.com/babe/Yu_Shinoda){:target="_blank"} all use `Yu Shinoda`, that remains the preferred option because it appears to be her own preferred romanization as well as the most commonly used spelling for English language databases. All other spellings that can be found should be used as aliases instead.
