### Preferred Performer Names
- **Prefer unique names over commonly used aliases, but otherwise no hard rules only suggestions.**

There are no hard guidelines for choosing primary performer names at this time. However, more unique aliases are almost always preferred over common single word names like "Lola" or "Tony". The following should also be taken into consideration: most frequently used alias, most famous/popular alias, most commonly used name on other databases like IAFD, and alias currently/recently preferred by the performer (often determined by social media profiles).

Also be aware that names are only eligible to be primary names if they've been used as an official adult credit, following the same requirements as [eligible performer aliases](#eligible-performer-aliases).

_Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval._

### Eligible Performer Aliases
- **Must have be used as an official adult credit, no legal names allowed except when a stage name is also their given name.**

Performer aliases must be names that have been used as official credits in an adult video performance. They do not have to be names used as performance aliases in a scene already listed on StashDB. This means that names that have been used professionally in non-adult mainstream performances, listed in credits or bylines as a writer or author, used on public social media accounts, or listed in news articles are not eligible to be listed on StashDB unless they've also been used as an official adult credit.

This also means that outside of the rare occasion of someone regularly using their given name instead of a stage name, **legal names are not allowed anywhere on StashDB**.

### JAV Performer Names
- **Western order with Latin characters as primary name, Japanese order and characters as aliases.**

JAV performers often have their names spelled in three different ways: Western order (GivenName FamilyName) with Latin characters, Japanese order (FamilyName GivenName) with Latin characters, and Japanese order with Japanese characters. Different sources will prefer different spellings. For StashDB, we prefer the Western order with Latin characters for all JAV performers as the primary name, matching the formatting of our non-JAV performers. This also makes things simpler for crossover performers who have worked in both western and JAV productions. The remaining two formats should always be included as aliases as well.

For example, [Marica Hase](https://stashdb.org/performers/d4f1a54f-ddc7-4f50-a356-d417802cab1c) has done many western scenes after starting on the JAV side of things. Regardless of whether she's considered a JAV performer or a western performer, her primary name is the same: `Marica Hase`. Alternate spellings `Hase Marica` and `はせまりか` are included as aliases. All three are the same name, just spelled three different ways following three different formats.

### Disambiguation Formatting
- **TBD.**
