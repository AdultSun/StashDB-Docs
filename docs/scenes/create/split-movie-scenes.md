# Split Movie Scenes

{: .important }
**Scenes split from movies only allowed when offered by studio's 1st party website, not 3rd party storefronts.**

---

Scenes split from full movies are only accepted in limited circumstances. Split scenes are expected to have a first party digital source as its primary source of info. Meaning, a scene from `Studio X` should be sourced from `StudioX.com`. All info (release date, title, description, scene aliases, etc.) should match the first party digital release when possible. If the scene did not have a first party digital release, then it is not eligible on StashDB at this time. We are waiting for further developments regarding movies and release groups on Stash-Box before including physical releases (VHS, DVD, etc.) and third party retailers (Adult DVD Empire, Hot Movies, etc.) on StashDB.

If a split scene is no longer available from the studio's website or if the studio's website no longer exists, it can still be added to StashDB. An archived page (from the Wayback Machine, for example) may be used as the primary source and studio link. If no archived page can be found, info may be sourced from third party databases (IAFD, Data18, etc.) instead. Also, don't forget to include the `Missing or Removed` tag for unavailable scenes.

Third party storefronts (Adult DVD Empire, Hot Movies, etc.) are not acceptable as a studio link. These URLs may be included in the edit comment if they were needed as a supplemental source of info.
